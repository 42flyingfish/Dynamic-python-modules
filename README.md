# Dynamic-python-modules
A project to polish a dynamic module handler for bots or engines.

Dynamic Loading.py handles module loads and unloads, while the Modules folder contains modules.
Module1.py and NumpyModule.py are simple testing files.
Each file contains a register function that is called to add itself to the system.
